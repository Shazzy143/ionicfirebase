    <h1>1. CHIEF MINISTER’S MESSAGE:</h1>
    <p>It gives me an immense pleasure to learn that the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Hyderabad has re-launched its website which is an informative as well as interactive. The Board should not only conduct the examination at school and college levels but it should take a lead role in education reforms for improving quality of education. Being an alumni of the Board and now its Controlling Authority I feel proud that it has significantly contributed to promoting quailty of education in the province but some how it could not maintain its standard in present time.</p>
